My first projects were very simple text based games written in C++. They are not very complex but they allowed me to learn good coding practice. I include these here for the sake of memories more than a showcase of my skills.



# Coin Removing Game
My first project for university was to create a text based game in c++ wherein you
 play against a computer to remove coins until there is one coin left, however you
 can only remove up to 5 coins at a time.

# Character Generator
My second project for university, a character generator in C++ that generates characters
 with random stats and history and creases a story with the generated information so that 
 they fit together in sentences.

# Peg Solitaire
My third project for University, in c++ I recreated peg solitaire which is a game where you have to jump
 pegs over other pegs to remove them until there are no pegs left on the board. I later modified it with more 
 complex rules wherein some pegs explode which destroy all adjacent pegs in it's vicinity.
