I achieved a mark of 94% for this game which I completed in my second year as part 
of my degree and is written in C++. In Mars Invasion, you play an alien spaceship on a mission to retake
Mars from the human colonials. You must traverse the mars skyline 
dodgeing and shooting as many human forces as possible all the while
making sure your fuel does not run out.
