A group project where we had to create a new quest for the game skyrim from scratch, which was
 biggest project I completed so far. It adds new levels, systems, scripted objects and more.
 I also created custom 3D models which was beyond what was required and turned it into a working 
 lightbulb in-game. Lightbulbs are not usually possible to make in Skyrim and thus required extra scripting.
