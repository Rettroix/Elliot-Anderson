My third project for University, in c++ I recreated peg solitaire which is a game where you have to jump
 pegs over other pegs to remove them until there are no pegs left on the board. I later modified it with more 
 complex rules wherein some pegs explode which destroy all adjacent pegs in it's vicinity.
