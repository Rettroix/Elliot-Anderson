This project was created for my masters year disseration. The following is from the abscract. 


Increasingly machine learning is being used across many industries. 
This is due to machine learning’s ability to process vast amounts of data 
(such as user information like search history and content interactions) and
 then offer personalised data to the user based on these factors. One industry 
 that could benefit from machine learning, is within the field of online video 
 game distribution. The largest platform for this, Steam, does not currently use 
 machine learning for its recommendation systems. (At the time of this projects creation, steam does use machine learning now) This project aims to prove the 
 effectiveness of this method within this industry by developing a recommendation
 model with machine learning and having participants evaluate its effectiveness in
 order to come to a conclusion whether it is better than current methods. The 
 results of the tests proved that machine learning models do in fact aide video
 game distribution platforms in user retention and the discoverability of games.
 This was shown in the results, as an overwhelming majority of participants 
 agreed that recommendations were accurate and felt the recommendations would 
 be persuasive enough for them to buy the recommended games without doing further 
 research for themselves. One thing presented that could be built upon after the 
 conclusion of the project, was that a more thorough comparison of the older methods
 could be made, with more plans for users to test both recommendations side by side. 
 Overall though, the project was a success.
