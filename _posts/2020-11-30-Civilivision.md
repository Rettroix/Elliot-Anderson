The aim of this project is to create a sandbox game which simulates the development of civilizations as they adapt and react to the generated conditions around them. 
I wanted to apply similar concepts from other games and have AI manage themselves autonomously without the need for player input. 
There is a big focus in making it feel like the cities are growing as time passes. The program would first generate terrain, animals and plants and a few tribal settlements. Based on the conditions surrounding such as resource availability they develop bigger and bigger, to towns and cities. Independently the citizens will get jobs, gather resources, hunt and go about their daily lives. 
There is emphasis on citizens being able to adapt and react to the terrain which is generated. Results that would like to be observed is how these citizens change the world as they grow. How much of an impact they can have and if where they are placed geographically can result in them dying out quicker than others.  
Throughout the project a literature review was carried out to learn about terrain generation algorithms and world simulation, the product was designed and was then implemented based on these designs.
The product was successful in showing a civilisation adapt and react to a generated terrain and shows them making a big impact on the world in terms of what they build, and their environmental impact as animals and plants are lessened where civilisations are built. It also shows how the environment effects the civilisations as areas with less wood for example would slow down building.
